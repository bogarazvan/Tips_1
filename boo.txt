 // String interpolation allows you to insert the value of almost any valid boo expression inside a string by quoting the expression with $().

 // The parentheses are unnecessary if the expression is just a variable:

 // String interpolation kicks in for both [double] and triple quoted strings:

 // You can scape the $ character to prevent interpolation:

 // You don't need to scape the $ char when it is not followed by the ( character:

 // Interpolation doesn't kick in inside [single quoted strings]:


s = "Right now it is {0}.  Say hi to {1}."
print s % (date.Now, "Mary")

//the above is basically shorthand for .NET's string.Format method:
mystr = string.Format("x = {0}, y = {1}", x, y)

//You can also pass the same parameters to Console.Write or WriteLine
//if you just want to print out a formatted string:
System.Console.WriteLine("x = {0}, y = {1}", x, y)
