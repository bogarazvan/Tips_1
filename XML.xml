<!-- 
	The term CDATA( Character Data ) is used about text data that should not be parsed by the XML parser.

	Characters like "<" and "&" are illegal in XML elements.

	"<" will generate an error because the parser interprets it as the start of a new element.

	"&" will generate an error because the parser interprets it as the start of an character entity.

	Some text, like JavaScript code, contains a lot of "<" or "&" characters. To avoid errors script code can be defined as CDATA.

	Everything inside a CDATA section is ignored by the parser.

	A CDATA section starts with "<![CDATA[" and ends with "]]>":
