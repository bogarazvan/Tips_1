                        SYMBOLIC MATHEMATICS

Prolog can be used for solving symbolic and mathematical problems.
Expressions can be modeled by composite objects. (In the program this
is demonstrated by EXPR)

In the example, the differentiation is followed by a reduction.

The formulas of differentiation are:

d(K)/dx      = 0.
d(x)/dx      = 1.
d(y)/dx      = 0.
d(F+G)/dx    = d(F)/dx+d(G)/dx.
d(F-G)/dx    = d(F)/dx-d(G)/dx.
d(F*G)/dx    = G*d(F)/dx+F*d(G)/dx.
d(F/G)/dx    = (F*d(G)/dx-G*d(F)/dx)/G^2
d(F^n)/dx    = n*F^(n-1)*d(F)/dx.
d(ln(F))/dx  = 1/F*d(F)/dx.
d(sin(F))/dx = cos(F)*d(F)/dx.
d(cos(F))/dx = -sin(F)*d(F)/dx.
d(tan(F))/dx = sec(F)^2*d(F)/dx.

Differentiation is realized by the predicate DIFF. Two parameters are 
used:
	1) The original expression
	2) The differentiated result

Each differentiation-rule has a corresponding rule in the predicate
diff.
