Geobase demonstrates a natural language interface to a database
on U.S. geography. Geobase allows you to query its database in
English rather than computerese.  For a more complete discussion 
of Geobase and its features please refer to Appendix F in the 
Reference Guide.

The database contains the following information:

Information about states:
  Area of the state in square kilometers
  Population of the state in citizens
  Capital of the state
  Which states border a given state
  Rivers in the state
  Cities in the state
  Highest and lowest point in the state in meters

Information about rivers:
  Length of river in kilometers

Information about cities:
  Population of the city in citizens


You can retrieve any or all of this information by asking questions
in normal English. Some sample queries:

   - states

   - give me the cities in california.

   - what is the biggest city in california ?

   - what is the longest river in the usa?

   - which rivers are longer than 1 thousand kilometers?

   - what is the name of the state with the lowest point ?

   - which states border alabama ?

   - which rivers do not run through texas

   - which rivers run through states that border the state
     with the capital austin?


You can modify Geobase as you work with it. If it doesn't
understand a word in one of your questions, you can add the word
to the language definition. The language is defined in a number
of relations, the most important one being the schema. A schema
is a description of the logical structure of a database. In
Geobase, the schema is the "entity network" for the language. A
schema entry follows the form: ENTITY ASSOCIATION ENTITY; this
signifies that the two entities are bound together by the given
association.

To display the relations and their schema, select View Language
from the Geobase main menu, then choose one of the items listed
below.


 1. Schema of relations

    The geographic data is stored in a number of relations. The
    schema for these relations is listed here.

 2. Schema of questions

    The schema for all possible questions that can be asked is listed
    here. For example, one possibility is:

    > population  of  city <

    That is, what is the population of a given city?

 3. Names of entities

    All known entities are listed here.

 4. Synonyms for entities

    Synonyms for entities are allowed. The previously defined
    synonyms are listed here; you can also add synonyms to the
    database dynamically.

 5. Synonyms for associations

    Synonyms for associations are allowed and can consist of
    more than one word.

 6. Words that are ignored

    Some words are simply ignored by the system since they are not
    directly relevant to the meaning of questions. Ignored words are
    listed here.

 7. Units for entities

    The units of measure for different entities are listed here. For
    instance, the unit for population is "number of citizens".

 8. Synonyms for relational operators

    There are several ways to say that a city is "bigger than" 1 million
    citizens or that a river is "shorter than" 1 thousand miles. These
    synonyms are listed here.

 9. Alternative ways to designate the minimum

    The different ways to designate adjectives for "minimum" are listed here.

10. Alternative ways to designate the maximum

    The different ways to designate adjectives for "maximum" are listed here.
